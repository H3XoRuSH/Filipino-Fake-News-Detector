# Filipino-Fake-News-Detector
This is a Chrome Extension that that sends an HTTP POST request to a partner API. The API returns what the extension should display. For your reference, the model is an exported Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier that predicts whether a piece of text is fake or not based on the Philippine context. The model and the documentation (Jupyter Notebook) can be found on this [link](https://github.com/Arukuen/faker).

# How to Run
Import the extension (using this folder). Please refer to this [link](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769).
